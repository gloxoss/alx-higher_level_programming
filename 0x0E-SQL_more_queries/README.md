# SQL - More Queries

Welcome to the **SQL - More Queries** project, part of the ALX Africa Intranet curriculum. In this project, you will dive deeper into SQL and MySQL concepts, focusing on user privileges, table creation, data retrieval, and more. By completing the tasks in this project, you will gain a better understanding of how to manage users, create tables, use constraints, and perform advanced queries.

## Project Overview

This project is designed to help you master the following learning objectives:

- Create and manage MySQL users and their privileges.
- Understand primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints.
- Retrieve data from multiple tables using various SQL techniques.
- Work with subqueries, joins, and unions to manipulate and retrieve data.
- Apply your knowledge of SQL concepts to real-world scenarios.

## Project Tasks

The project consists of several tasks, each focusing on a specific aspect of SQL and database management. Here's an overview of the tasks you'll complete:

1. **My Privileges**: Create a MySQL user and assign privileges.
2. **Root User**: Create a script to create a MySQL server user.
3. **Read User**: Create a script to create a read-only user for a specific database.
4. **Always a Name**: Create a table with NOT NULL constraints.
5. **ID Can't be Null**: Create a table with a primary key constraint.
6. **Unique ID**: Create a table with a unique primary key.
7. **States Table**: Create a database and a states table.
8. **Cities Table**: Create a database and a cities table with a foreign key.
9. **Cities of California**: List cities from a specific state.
10. **Genre ID by Show**: List shows with genres linked.
11. **Genre ID for All Shows**: List all shows and their genres.
12. **No Genre**: List shows without a genre.
13. **Number of Shows by Genre**: List genres and their show counts.
14. **My Genres**: List genres of a specific show.
15. **Only Comedy**: List Comedy shows.
16. **List Shows and Genres**: List shows and their linked genres.

## Getting Started

To begin, make sure you have MySQL 8.0 installed on your system (Ubuntu 20.04 LTS). You will be working with SQL scripts, creating users, tables, and performing queries. The tasks are designed to help you gain practical experience in database management using SQL.

## Instructions

1. Clone the repository from the [ALX Higher Level Programming GitHub repository](https://github.com/alx-higher-level-programming).
2. Navigate to the `0x0E-SQL_more_queries` directory.
3. Inside this directory, you will find a set of SQL script files corresponding to each task.
4. Read the description and requirements of each task in the script file.
5. Complete each task by writing the SQL code required to meet the objectives.
6. Test your SQL scripts by running them against the provided MySQL server.
7. Once you complete each task, check your work and make sure it produces the expected results.

## Project Completion

Upon completing this project, you will have gained a deeper understanding of SQL concepts, user privileges, constraints, subqueries, joins, and more. Your ability to write efficient SQL queries, create and manage tables, and retrieve data from relational databases will be greatly improved.
